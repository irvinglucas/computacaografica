To create an object from an .obj file just type as " my_obj = OBJ("my_obj.obj", swapyz=True) " where my_obj.obj is the obj file name.

To render an .OBJ file call "render()" from util.py passing the obj, a list with x, y and z transfor positions, a list with x, y and z rotation as well as a list with x, y and z scale.
